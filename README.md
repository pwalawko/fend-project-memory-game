## Instructions

### How to play

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### End of game

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

### Features

When the player clicks the first card, the timer starts. It ends when the last pair is matched.
The moves are counted. One move is one opened pair. The user can see how many moves they made, and on the base of moves the user gets the rating in stars:
- less than 15 moves - 3 stars,
- 15 to 19 moves - 2 stars,
- 20 to 24 moves - 1 star,
- more than 25 moves - 0 stars.

At the end of the game the modal box appears with detailed info about the users performance (their time, moves number and stars number).
